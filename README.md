Business-Dost Android App
Business-Dost is an android application built with the aim to simplify the process of tracking, managing raw materials and keep track of all the transactions with vendors and customers. 

  
The UI of the application has been kept simple as the users are either micro or medium scale entrepreneurs. Many different features have been added to the application without increasing complexity of the UI.

FIREBASE
The app makes considerable use of the following Firebase components:
•	Firebase is our source for all user data (events starred or reserved by a user). Firebase gave us automatic sync and also seamlessly managed offline functionality for us.
•	Firebase Functions allowed us to run the backend code.
